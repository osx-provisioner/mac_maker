## Mac Maker

A portable single binary configuration tool for OSX machines.

- Brings [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) powered Configuration Management to your Mac.
- Mix and match existing Ansible roles such [asdf](https://github.com/osx-provisioner/role-asdf), [clamav](https://github.com/osx-provisioner/role-clamav) and [homeshick](https://github.com/osx-provisioner/role-homeshick) with the huge array of Mac roles on [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/).

### Generate a consistent, reproducible "profile" of your machine

- Start with a freshly installed Mac, and apply a `Mac Maker Profile` to add all the customizations and applications you want.
- Alternatively, start with an existing Mac you already use, and incrementally build a `Mac Maker Profile` putting all your existing apps and customizations under version control.

## Quick Start

### How do I use this?

If you'd like to try it out, head over to the [Mac Maker Releases](https://github.com/osx-provisioner/mac_maker/releases) and download a pre-built binary.

- There are builds available for **Catalina**, **Big Sur** and **Monterey** for **Intel Macs**.
- There are now builds for **Monterey** available for **Apple Silicon Macs**.  (Thanks to the folks at [bitrise](https://bitrise.io/))

If you are unsure, use the tables below to help you find the right binary for your Mac:

| Version Number  | OS Name  |
|-----------------|----------|
| 13              | Ventura  |
| 12              | Monterey |
| 11              | Big Sur  |
| 10              | Catalina |

| Architecture | CPU Type      |
|--------------|---------------|
| arm64        | Apple Silicon |
| x86_64       | Intel         |

**Please Note**:
- They are unsigned, and not notarized by Apple.
- As such, they will trigger a warning about software from an unidentified developer.

### OK, but you still didn't tell me how to get started...

Are you on Monterey or Ventura?  It may not ship with python anymore!  We better check:
- open a terminal and type `python3`, and if prompted to install the [x-code](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) cli tools click `install`.
- this is less than ideal, but it gets you into a compatible state quickly

For Catalina, Big Sur, Monterey and Ventura (once you've confirmed [python](https://python.org) is present):
- Copy the `mac_maker` binary to the OSX machine you'd like to put under configuration management.
- If you have a working internet connection, you can start working with `Mac Maker Profiles`.  
- To try creating your own `Profile`, check out [this](https://github.com/osx-provisioner/profile-generator) repository.
- To learn more about `Mac Maker Profiles`, and to try out a simple example, continue reading here.

### Mac Maker Profiles

Mac Maker uses the concept of `Profiles`, to bundle together the Ansible configuration required to configure your Mac.

Here's an [example profile](https://github.com/osx-provisioner/profile-example) for you to test out:

1. Start Mac Maker: `./mac_maker`
2. Run the these commands, to check and apply the profile
  - `precheck github https://github.com/osx-provisioner/profile-example`
  - `apply github https://github.com/osx-provisioner/profile-example`

You can work with `Profiles` in one of two ways:

- Create a public GitHub Repository that contains your profile, taking care NOT to included privileged content.
- Create your profile in any private git repository, and clone it to a USB key (or other portable media).  Add a `spec.json` file to the USB stick telling Mac Maker how to find it.

To find out more:

- Read about the `Mac Maker Profiles`, and how to build one [here](https://mac-maker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/project/4.profiles.html).
- Use [this template](https://github.com/osx-provisioner/profile-generator) to create your own custom profiles.
- Read about the `spec.json` file, and how to build one [here](https://mac-maker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/project/5.spec_files.html).

**Please Note:**
- We've had some user feedback that the `spec.json` files are a bit complicated to get started with.
- Although we'll continue to support them, we'll soon introduce the ability to simply specify the path to a `Mac Maker Profile` folder on the local filesystem.
